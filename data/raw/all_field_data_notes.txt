# of individuals was calculated as:
- Adults - area of bees * 1.45 bees per cm2
- Eggs - area of open brood * 3.96 cells per cm2 * 0.33 (assuming open cells are spread evenly across all ages, 1/3 should be eggs)
- Pupae - area of capped brood * 3.96 cells per cm2
- Larave - area of open brood * 3.96 cells per cm2 * 0.66 (assuming open cells are spread evenly across all ages, 2/3 should be larvae)
